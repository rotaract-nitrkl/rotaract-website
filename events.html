					The members of the Rotaract Club of NIT Rourkela, visited OSAP Battalion, sector-2 on 24th of March, to organize a Menstrual Awareness Campaign. The event was themed, SaPNA: Sanitary Pads 'n Awareness. The money collected during fundraising events like Housie and V'day are reimbursed in this event. The prime purpose was setting up platforms that encourage discussions about menstruation and, raise awareness amongst the slum women on the necessity of using sanitary pads. The atmosphere was eased with the screening of the movie "Padman". The ladies of different age groups gathered and they were told about the safety precautions that they should uptake during menstruation. There was a door to door sanitary pads distribution. The happiness on their face, after the interactive session, was our biggest reward.</p>
					<p><strong>The Rotaract family hopes to bring joy to each and every one.</strong></p>

            <p class="text-white-50 mb-5">It is an initiative by our club for the prevention and cure of ocean pollution. It was held during Innovision 2018- the technomanagement fest of NIT Rourkela. Thos event witnessed a formation of human chain in the shape of OCEAN and was captured with the help of a drone. The participants of the human chain were given freebies such as caps and arm bands. Photo booths were also made by us and stationed in the ground where the event took place. This social event was a huge success and made it to newspapers.
              There, the BlueLink event was a stepping stone towards stopping ocean pollution and proving <strong>#IndiaSpeaksBlueToo</strong></p>

            <p class="text-white-50 mb-5">BlueTalk was an awareness program organised in collaboration with Hourglass club of nIT Rourkela with an aim to create awareness about environment's degrading situation.<strong>"Ocean pollution- the greatest tragedy of our generation"</strong> was thoroughly discussed during the entire event. A presentation was delivered by the members of Hourglass demonstrating the 'WHAT,HOW,WHYs' of ocean pollution. A Question-answer session was held after the presentation to help the audience understand what the club was doing towards eliminating ocean pollution.It was a precursor to our event BlueLink.

            Our ocean is in dire need of help. Garbage dumped into the ocean is continuously degrading its quality. Animals are dying and water-borne diseases are spreading and this was just a small step towards starting a revolution. </p>
