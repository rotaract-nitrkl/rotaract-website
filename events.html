							The members of the Rotaract Club of NIT Rourkela, visited OSAP Battalion, sector-2 on 24th of March, to organize a Menstrual Awareness Campaign. The event was themed, SaPNA: Sanitary Pads 'n Awareness. The money collected during
							fundraising events like Housie and V'day are reimbursed in this event. The prime purpose was setting up platforms that encourage discussions about menstruation and, raise awareness amongst the slum women on the necessity of using
							sanitary pads. The atmosphere was eased with the screening of the movie "Padman". The ladies of different age groups gathered and they were told about the safety precautions that they should uptake during menstruation. There was a door
							to door sanitary pads distribution. The happiness on their face, after the interactive session, was our biggest reward.</p>

								tragedy of our generation"</strong> was thoroughly discussed during the entire event. A presentation was delivered by the members of Hourglass demonstrating the 'WHAT,HOW,WHYs' of ocean pollution. A Question-answer session was held
